To run the last code from Session 5
Run the model for 25 epochs for each:
without L1/L2 with BN
without L1/L2 with GBN
with L1 with BN
with L1 with GBN
with L2 with BN
with L2 with GBN
with L1 and L2 with BN
with L1 and L2 with GBN
Plot a single graph for validation accuracy for the above 8 scenarios
Plot a single graph for loss change for the above 8 scenarios
Find any 25 misclassified images for "without L1/L2 with BN" AND "without L1/L2 with GBN" model
